Notes:

Provided are 
- An assembly model in Fusion360 native format
- An assembly model in STEP format for other CAD platforms
- A nest model in Fusion360 format, to tweak CAM settings
- The proven NC file I used to make the part

The NC file uses the 1/4" 1 Flute bit available in the Maslow store. The settings used are those I found to best work with the tool through trial and error. The F values can be changed to work with other tooling.
